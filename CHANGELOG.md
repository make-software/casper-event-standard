### Changed

- `CLType::Any` is not supported anymore.
All parts of an event need to be `non-Any` `CLValue`s.
The check happens at the runtime in `to_bytes()` function.
`Any` causes problems to parse events in a generic
way because of the lack of a length indicator.

- `emit` and `init` has now `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`
implementations that panic when used. It is mostly for the easy of development.
